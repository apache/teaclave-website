On behalf of the Teaclave community, I am happy to announce the release of
Teaclave TrustZone SDK 0.6.0.

Teaclave empowers developers to build memory-safe Trusted Applications across
diverse confidential computing platforms, including Intel SGX and Arm TrustZone.
Apache Teaclave TrustZone SDK, a subproject of Apache Teaclave, is based on the
OP-TEE project, a widely used open-source TrustZone OS.

This release aligns with the OP-TEE quarterly release schedule and is compatible
with OP-TEE 4.7.0. It introduces major improvements across features, build
workflows, and documentation. Highlights include new TLS client and server
examples built on the latest Rustls, a significant refactoring of the Object
component for better maintainability, and enhancements to the build system and
CI pipeline with separated test workflows, new environment configurations for
building standard TAs, and simplified Makefiles. Documentation has also been
refreshed for consistency, clarity, and an improved developer experience.

For more details, please refer to our release notes:
